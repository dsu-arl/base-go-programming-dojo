# Welocme to the Go Dojo
This dojo will introduce you to the Golang programming language, commonly called Go, and what it has to offer!

# What is Go?
According to their (website)[https://go.dev/], Go is an open-source programming language released by Google in 2009. Go brings some of the best things of compiled languages (like C/C++) and interpreted languages (like Python) together. If you have experience in either or both of those languages, some features of Go will feel familiar.

# Getting Started
Below are some recommendations if you want to build your own development environment. For this Dojo everything will be provided for you, so only continue if you are interested in doing local development.

There is a lot to learn about the Go environment other than just programming. In this Dojo we'll cover some of those elements as they become necessary, but a full discussion of the Go build environment is outside of this scope; more information is just a quick search-engine query away! Below are some quick links to help get you started.

## Development Environment
This environment will utilize (VSCode)[https://code.visualstudio.com/download] as the development environment. However, the company JetBrains supports an excellent product called (GoLand)[https://www.jetbrains.com/go/] that is built to support the Go programming lanugage. It has many built-in features that make developing in Go faster and simplier, and has different tiers of support.

## Go runtime
To develop in Go, you must download and install Go. Instructions for different operating systems are found on the (Go website)[https://go.dev/doc/install].

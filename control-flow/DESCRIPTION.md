# Control Flow Statements
Now that you've learned about collecting and storing values, how do you use them? What do you do if you ask a user for a number between 1 and 100 and they give you 1,000,000? This module will teach you how to check for that, and many other elements. But first, what is control flow?

All progams have a purpose: collecting user data, generating reports, monitoring services, etc. To achieve the desired goals, programmers not only need to collect information from users (and/or other sources) but must ensure that information conforms to their expectations. Imagine a program that's sole responsibility is to ensure the temperature of a room remains at 70 degrees fahrenheit. Now imagine that program receives data from a second program, that's sole job is to calculate the room temperature. However instead of fahrenheit, this program calculates room temperature in celsius. Imagine the ensuing chaos when the first program is told the room temperature is 21 degrees (celsius) instead of 70 degrees (fahrenheit)! There would be a lot of extremely uncomfortable people in that building. Control flow statements provide programmers a way to check their data, and perform actions based on the results.

Control flow structures also provide ways to perform an action multiple times, or perform an action until it meets certain criteria. Thanks to control flow statements, programmers can account for a wide variety of scenarios and create complex and feature rich applications.

This module will teach you about:
- for loops, infinite loops, and "while" loops
- if / if else / if else blocks
- logical operators
- switch statements
- defer statements

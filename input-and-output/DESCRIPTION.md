# Input and Output Module
This module will teach you the fundamentals of how Go prints to the screen and takes input from users. 
Sending data to the screen is the fundamental way that programs interact with users. If you don't send data to the user there's no way for them to interact with your program! In Go, there are a few different choices to print data, depending on your intent.

For all these challenges you will be required to write a Go program with the `.go` extension. You can name these files whatever you want. In challenges when you see `yourFile.go`, replace that with the file you made. To run a Go program, first you must compile it with `go build yourFile.go` and then `./yourFile` to run it.
